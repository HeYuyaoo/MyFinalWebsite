                    My name is Caroline. I come from China. I take part in computer programming in 
                    this summer school. The reason why I choose UCLA is that I love the environment of 
                    the campus and the food of restaurants. The most important point is that the class 
                    is suitable for me.

                        Because of the introduction on the Internet, we went to the Elysian Park for taking photo. It's an excellent place
                        since we can see the full view of Los Angelas! Amazing experience! I also tried an ice cream which I have never tasted
                        before! It's a wonderful day! A perfect weekend! I love lA!!
